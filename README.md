The timer features a circular progress ring that smoothly animates as time progresses, with a subtle pulse effect when active to provide gentle visual feedback without being distracting.

- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Optimized timer logic with proper cleanup
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Accessibility

- Proper contrast ratios for all text and UI elements
- Adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44pt)
- Haptic feedback for all interactions
- Support for system accessibility features
